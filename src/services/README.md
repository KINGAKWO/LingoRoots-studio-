# Services

This directory is intended to house modules that interact with backend services, such as:

- Firestore database operations (CRUD for lessons, quizzes, user progress, etc.)
- Interactions with Firebase Functions
- Other third-party API integrations

This helps in centralizing data fetching and backend logic, making the application more maintainable and testable, as outlined in the System Architecture document.
